## histeo_cancer 

Hello, this is a old repository that I had hidden, it contains only a simple notebook with a simple conv net that I did way back when. It simplealy creates a binary classification on a kaggle dataset. 

The dataset is a computer vision dataset that can be seen in:  
https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection

#### Code base 
The code was compleately written in pytorch and is honestly nothing special. 

#### dataset location
The dataset should be placed in assets and all cells should be easy enoght to re-run. To download the dataset please use the kaggle api and run:

'kaggle competitions download -c histopathologic-cancer-detection'
